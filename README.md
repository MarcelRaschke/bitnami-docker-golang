# What is Go?

> Go is an object oriented programming language with sensible primitives, static typing and reflection. It also supports packages for efficient management of dependencies.

[Golang](https://golang.org/)

# TL;DR

```console
$ docker run --name golang bitnami/golang:latest
```

## Docker Compose

```console
$ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-golang/master/docker-compose.yml > docker-compose.yml
$ docker-compose up -d
```

# Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading Linux distribution.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Docker Content Trust (DCT)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/). You can use `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released daily with the latest distribution packages available.

# Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami Golang Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/golang).

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/golang:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/golang/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/golang:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself.

```console
$ docker build -t bitnami/golang:latest 'https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-golang.git#master:1.14/debian-10'
```

# Persisting your application

For persistence you should mount a directory at the `/bitnami` path. If the mounted directory is empty, it will be initialized on the first run.

```console
$ docker run \
    -v /path/to/golang-persistence:/bitnami \
    bitnami/golang:latest
```

You can also do this with a minor change to the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-golang/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

```yaml
golang:
  ...
  volumes:
    - /path/to/golang-persistence:/bitnami
  ...
```

# Connecting to other containers

Using [Docker container networking](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/), a different server running inside a container can easily be accessed by your application containers and vice-versa.

Containers attached to the same network can communicate with each other using the container name as the hostname.

## Using the Command Line

### Step 1: Create a network

```console
$ docker network create golang-network --driver bridge
```

### Step 2: Launch the Golang container within your network

Use the `--network <NETWORK>` argument to the `docker run` command to attach the container to the `golang-network` network.

```console
$ docker run --name golang-node1 --network golang-network bitnami/golang:latest
```

### Step 3: Run another containers

We can launch another containers using the same flag (`--network NETWORK`) in the `docker run` command. If you also set a name to your container, you will be able to use it as hostname in your network.

# Configuration

CHANGEME: Add configuration section

# Logging

The Bitnami Golang Docker image sends the container logs to `stdout`. To view the logs:

```console
$ docker logs golang
```

You can configure the containers [logging driver](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/) using the `--log-driver` option if you wish to consume the container logs differently. In the default configuration docker uses the `json-file` driver.

# Maintenance

## Upgrade this image

Bitnami provides up-to-date versions of Golang, including security patches, soon after they are made upstream. We recommend that you follow these steps to upgrade your container.

### Step 1: Get the updated image

```console
$ docker pull bitnami/golang:latest
```

### Step 2: Stop the running container

Stop the currently running container using the command

```console
$ docker stop golang
```

### Step 3: Remove the currently running container

```console
$ docker rm -v golang
```

### Step 4: Run the new image

Re-create your container from the new image.

```console
$ docker run --name golang bitnami/golang:latest
```
